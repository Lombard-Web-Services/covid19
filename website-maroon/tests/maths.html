    <h1>Arithmetic progression applied on legend colors</h1>
  	<p> On the first page of this website, I have used a function to adapt the positive numbers of the dataset to the legend of the map. This algorithm is working for linear normalization. 
  	The rgb triplet matrix is named N set 
  	$$N=[RGB]$$
  	x is a color associated into the rgb matrix
  	$$x_{color}\in N$$ 
  	S is an arithmetic sequence where x min and x max values are into the interval.
  	$$S_{x}=\{x \in N \mid x_{min} \leq n \leq x_{max} \} $$
	So x could be a real number  $$x \in \mathbb{R}$$
	After that we can create a quantifier for our legend knowing the maximum values of our set, I have commutated for each colors the color number with the xmax value divided by the n number of colors I wish to display. 
	$$ \forall{x} P(x) = \sum{x_{color}} * (\frac{x_{max}} n_{color} )$$

    <h1>Standard Deviation (regression tree algorithm) applied on COVID 19 data</h1>
    <p>Following this numerical sample, based on 7 days of Deaths people in France because of the COVID-19 virus since 2nd May 2020 (from Johns Hopkins University data), I have used a Standard Deviation (From decision tree algorithm) to calculate the homogeneity of the numerical sample.
    Example:x
    Our sequence of positive numbers :
    $$A = \{369,242,437,367,427,289,218\} $$
    The count of this sequence is $$n_{A} = 7$$
    The average $$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x} n = 335.571$$
    The standard deviation $$S = \sqrt{ \frac{(\sum x - \bar{x})^{2}} n} = 80.622$$
    The Coefficient of variation is $$CV = \frac{S}{\bar{x}} * 100 \% = 24.03 $$  
    </p>
    <p>By comparing the coefficient of variation with the number of deaths over 7, 14 , 31 days we can estimate more precisely the variation of the epidemy trough time. Moreover these numbers open the possibilities to estimate the efficiency of the confinement measures and their impact related to these 4 following factors : Active, Deaths, Recovered, Confirmed.</p>
